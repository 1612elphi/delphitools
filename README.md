# DelphiTools

A collection of small, low stakes and low effort tools. No logins, no registration, no data collection. I can't believe I have to say that. Long live the handmade web. If you find these tools useful, I'm glad. You don't owe me anything. But if you're an artist, feel free to email me your work. I'd love to see it.
